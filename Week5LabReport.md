# **Week 5 Lab Report** by Malcolm Park (Jooahn)

This weeks lab report will focus on commands that are used in bash scripts. In particular, I will be focusing on the grep command, variations I can use with grep, and examples of using it with the written_2 data.

## Variations of grep command I will use
These command extensions were all found with [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)
```
grep -c : This command will return the number of lines that match a string
grep -n : This command will display the line number in addition to the actual output of the matched line.
grep -i : This command acts as a case insenstive search
grep -1 : This command will display the name of the files that match a string 
```

### grep -c
